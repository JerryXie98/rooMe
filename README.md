# Feed-Us
Originally intended to help connect people who share common interests.

Now it aims to help people find company to grab food with.

## Frontend

The frontend is done all through React.

### Development
```
cd frontend

yarn install

yarn start
```

### Deployment
```
npm run build
```

Once the build is complete, drag the "build" folder into the "api" folder.

The react app can also be deployed separately (which we did on heroku).

## Backend
The backend is built with [stdlib](https://stdlib.com/).

To deploy directly onto the cloud:

```
cd api

lib up dev
```
